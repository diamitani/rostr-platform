# SOP Architect

## Overview

Transforms raw process descriptions, interview notes, or existing documentation into polished, team-ready Standard Operating Procedures. The skill structures workflows, identifies missing steps and edge cases, and enforces clarity so every team member can follow the procedure with minimal ramp-up. Outputs are formatted for direct use in wikis, Notion, training docs, or compliance records.

## When to Use

- You have a process description (verbal, written, or in meeting notes) and need it turned into a formal SOP.
- An existing SOP is outdated, inconsistent, or missing critical steps — you need a gap analysis and rewrite.
- You are onboarding new team members and want clear, repeatable procedure docs.
- You need SOPs that satisfy compliance, audit, or ISO requirements.
- Don't use for: strategy docs, project plans, or one-off task lists that don't repeat.

## How It Works

1. **Ingest** — Accepts a process in any form: bullet points, transcript, rough notes, or an existing SOP draft.
2. **Structure** — Maps the process into a standard SOP template: Purpose, Scope, Prerequisites, Step-by-Step Procedure, Expected Outcomes, Exception Handling, and Roles.
3. **Gap Analysis** — Flags missing decision points, ambiguous steps, unhandled edge cases, and missing roles.
4. **Format** — Produces clean markdown or rich-text output with numbered steps, conditional branches, and clear role assignments.

## Steps

1. **Gather the process:** Ask the user to describe the workflow or paste existing notes. Prompt for: who does it, what triggers it, what tools are involved, and what the desired outcome is.
2. **Draft the SOP:** Produce a structured draft with all standard sections. Use numbered steps with clear actor (role) for each. Ask clarifying questions for any ambiguous steps.
3. **Gap check:** Review the draft against these questions:
   - Are there preconditions or approvals not mentioned?
   - What happens when a step fails — is there a fallback?
   - Are all roles, tools, and access requirements listed?
   - Are there time-sensitive or compliance-sensitive steps?
4. **Polish for adoption:** Simplify language for a new team member. Add brief "Why this step matters" notes where the rationale isn't obvious.
5. **Deliver:** Present the final SOP in the user's preferred format, with a summary of gaps identified and filled.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Vague action verbs:** "Handle the request" is useless. Every step must have a concrete verb + object + destination (e.g., "Forward the ticket to `#eng-support` in Slack with the `urgent` tag").
2. **Missing role assignments:** Every step needs an explicit actor. "The request is approved" → ask: by whom? In what system?
3. **No exception paths:** Happy-path-only SOPs break in production. Always include "If X fails, then Y" branches.
4. **Over-engineering:** Not every process needs a 20-page SOP. Match the depth to the risk and frequency of the task.
5. **No verification criteria:** The SOP must define what "done" looks like — a checklist item, a status change, or a notification sent.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Every step has a concrete action verb and clear actor
- [ ] Purpose and Scope sections are present and correct
- [ ] Prerequisites (tools, access, approvals) are listed
- [ ] Exception/error paths are documented
- [ ] Expected outcome is measurable
- [ ] Output is formatted for the target platform (Notion, wiki, Confluence, etc.)
- [ ] User confirmed no missing steps
