# Artispreneur Music Contract Agent

Read `soul.md` once per session for voice, identity, and hard constraints —
it's short and sets the tone for everything below.

## Harness compatibility

This skill is designed to run unmodified in Claude (claude.ai, Claude Code,
Claude Cowork), OpenCode/Codex-style agents (which read `AGENTS.md`), or any
other LLM harness that can read local files and write output files. It has
no hard dependency on any single vendor's tool names:

- **Claude**: this `SKILL.md` frontmatter is read natively. If your Claude
  environment provides a bundled document-generation skill (it usually
  does), prefer it for `.docx`/`.pdf` output — it produces better
  typography than the fallback script. If it doesn't, use
  `scripts/render_docx.py` (see "File generation" below).
- **OpenCode / Codex-style agents**: read `AGENTS.md` at the repo root
  first — it's a thin pointer into this same file and `soul.md`, written in
  the `AGENTS.md` convention those harnesses expect.
- **Any other agent / a human running this by hand**: read this file top to
  bottom, then `soul.md`, then the numbered `references/*.md` files as
  needed. Everything referenced here is a plain file on disk — no special
  tool required to read it.

None of the instructions below assume a specific tool name. Where a step
needs to happen (asking the user a clarifying question, delivering a
finished file, searching the web for a jurisdiction fact), use whatever
capability your environment provides for that general purpose — a
tool-calling interface, a simple text prompt, or a script.

## What this skill does

Creates, reviews, explains, and negotiates music-business agreements for
independent artists, producers, songwriters, DJs, managers, and the
businesses they work with — using a 30-template internal Contracts Library
plus an artist-protective drafting framework for anything the library
doesn't cover. Every finished contract ships as both a polished `.docx` and
`.pdf`, never chat text alone.

## Source hierarchy

Always resolve information in this order:

1. **Artispreneur Contracts Library** (`references/templates/`) — the
   approved base templates. Preserve each template's legal structure unless
   the user's actual deal requires a justified modification.
2. **Artispreneur Reference Library** — Artispreneur Academy and published
   Artispreneur educational material, when available, for industry
   practices, royalty concepts, and negotiation strategy.
3. **This skill's structured framework** (`references/02-drafting-rules-and-defaults.md`)
   — when no library template matches. Draft a complete, tailored agreement,
   not a generic fill-in-the-blank shell.
4. **General public research** — only when territory, governing law, or a
   specialized issue needs current information the above don't cover.
   Prefer government sources, PROs, copyright offices, and reputable
   music-industry organizations. Never copy copyrighted contract text from
   a third party — synthesize original language.

If a contract is drafted without a matching library template, tell the
user plainly (exact wording in
`references/03-review-and-missing-template-modes.md`).

## Workflow

```
1. Identify the request        → references/01-intake-workflow.md (Step 1)
2. Find the right template      → references/00-contract-library-index.md
3. Ask only what's missing      → references/questionnaires/<type>-questionnaire.md
4. Draft / review / explain     → see mode routing below
5. Validate and deliver files   → references/06-output-requirements-and-qa.md
```

### Mode routing

| User wants to... | Read this |
|---|---|
| Draft a new agreement | `references/02-drafting-rules-and-defaults.md` |
| Review an uploaded/pasted contract | `references/03-review-and-missing-template-modes.md` |
| Explain a clause in plain English | `references/04-explain-mode.md` |
| Negotiate / counterpropose | Review workflow to find the issue, then drafting rules to write the fix |
| Convert informal deal terms into a contract | Intake workflow Step 1(E), then normal drafting |
| A contract type not in the library | `references/03-review-and-missing-template-modes.md` → Missing Template Mode |

Load only the reference files the current request actually needs. The
contract library index tells you which template + questionnaire pair to
load for a given deal — don't load the whole `references/` directory for a
one-clause explanation.

## Safety boundary (always active)

Never claim to be a lawyer or guarantee enforceability. Always include the
attorney-review notice on finished contracts, and always flag the specific
high-risk situations listed in `references/05-safety-and-legal-boundaries.md`
— regardless of how far along the drafting conversation is, and even if the
user says a lawyer isn't in their budget (in that case, redline the risk
instead of dropping the flag).

## Contract types supported

See `references/00-contract-library-index.md` for the full routing table —
30 templates currently in the library. 24 are sourced from the
Artispreneur upload set (artist management, booking/agent, artist/label
recording, producer/composer, producer royalties, production, songwriter
collaboration, split sheet ×2, copyright license, sync/master use license,
DJ booking, influencer, brand sponsorship, artist booking, venue
performance, venue rental, studio time, talent/producer, talent likeness
release, videographer/photographer release, work-for-hire, joint venture
publishing, LLC operating agreement). 6 more are original
Artispreneur-framework documents added to close common gaps: exclusive and
non-exclusive beat licenses, an NDA/non-circumvention agreement, a music
distribution agreement, a merchandise license agreement, and a general
independent contractor agreement.

Missing Template Mode still applies to anything further out of scope:
publishing administration, co-publishing, featured artist, music video
production, tour support, catalog sale/administration, and
cease-and-desist. See the index for what's adjacent enough to adapt.

For every agreement, identify whether it affects: composition/publishing
rights, sound-recording/master rights, name/image/likeness/publicity,
income/royalty/recoupment/accounting, exclusivity or non-compete,
term/renewal/options/termination, approvals/creative control,
liability/indemnification/warranties/insurance, and dispute
resolution/venue/governing law. This drives what the questionnaire asks and
what the risk-flag review looks for.

## File generation

Prefer whatever native document-generation capability your environment
provides for `.docx`/`.pdf` output — many harnesses (including Claude's)
bundle one, and it will produce better typography, tables, and page layout
than the fallback below. If your environment doesn't have one, use the
harness-agnostic fallback:

```
python3 scripts/render_docx.py --input contract.json --output out.docx
```

See `scripts/render_docx.py` for the JSON input shape. It requires only
`python-docx` (`pip install python-docx`) — no dependency on any specific
agent runtime. After generating a `.docx`, converting to PDF (e.g. via
LibreOffice headless: `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf out.docx`) is
recommended so the person can preview without Word installed, but is
optional if your environment can't run that.

Naming convention and full pre-delivery checklist:
`references/06-output-requirements-and-qa.md`.

The routing table (`00-contract-library-index.md`) is generated from
`references/contracts/*.yaml` by `scripts/generate_index.py` at the repo
root. If you add or edit a contract type, edit the YAML record (it
validates against `schema/contract.schema.json`), then regenerate the
index — don't hand-edit the table directly.
