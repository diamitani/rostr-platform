## Frameworks

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
**Best for**: Direct pain-point messaging, clear problem-solution fit

**Structure**:
- **P — Problem** (1 sentence): State the specific pain they feel
- **A — Agitate** (1 sentence): Make it real with a specific observation
- **S — Solution** (1 sentence): Show how you solve it
- **CTA** (1 sentence): Low-friction next step

### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)
**Best for**: Transformation stories, aspirational outcomes

**Structure**:
- **Before**: Current painful state
- **After**: Ideal future state
- **Bridge**: How your product gets them there

### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
**Best for**: Longer-form, nurture sequences

**Structure**:
- **Attention**: Hook that stops the scroll
- **Interest**: Relevant problem/insight
- **Desire**: Vision of success
- **Action**: Clear CTA

## Email Templates

### Template 1: PAS Cold Email
```
Subject: {{company}}'s outbound — quick question

Hi {{first_name}},

Most {{title_category}} I talk to at {{company_size}} companies tell me {{pain_point}} is costing them {{metric}}.

When I looked at {{company}}'s {{trigger_event}}, it seemed like you might be dealing with the same thing.

{{product_name}} helps {{icp_description}} {{achieve_outcome}} without {{painful_alternative}} — typically in under {{timeframe}}.

Worth a 15-min call this week to see if it makes sense for {{company}}?

{{sender_first_name}}
```

### Template 2: BAB Cold Email
```
Subject: How {{similar_company}} solved {{pain_point}}

Hi {{first_name}},

Before: {{similar_company}} was {{before_state}} — {{negative_outcome}}.

After: Now they're {{after_state}} — {{positive_outcome}}.

The bridge? They started using {{product_name}} to {{key_action}}.

I'd love to show you how {{company}} could see similar results. Got 15 minutes this week?

{{sender_first_name}}
```

### Template 3: Trigger Event Email
```
Subject: Congrats on {{trigger_event}}

Hi {{first_name}},

Saw {{company}} just {{trigger_event_detail}} — congrats!

Companies at this stage often struggle with {{pain_point}} as they scale.

We've helped {{number}} similar {{icp_type}} companies {{achieve_outcome}} during this exact transition.

Would it be helpful to share how they did it? Happy to send over a quick case study.

{{sender_first_name}}
```

### Template 4: Social Proof Email
```
Subject: {{similar_company}} + {{company}} have something in common

Hi {{first_name}},

Just wrapped up a project with {{similar_company}} — they were dealing with {{pain_point}} just like {{company}} might be.

Result: {{quantified_outcome}}

I'm reaching out because {{company}} seems like a great fit for a similar approach.

Would you be open to a quick call to see if we can replicate those results for you?

{{sender_first_name}}
```

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my last note. I wanted to share a quick insight:

Worth a quick chat?

```

**Day 7 — Social Proof**
```
Subject: How {{similar_company}} solved this

{{similar_company}} was in a similar spot — {{pain_point}}.

After working with us: {{quantified_result}}

If you're curious how, I'd be happy to share more.

{{sender_first_name}}
```

**Day 14 — Break-Up**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi {{first_name}},

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing the timing isn't right.

Totally understand — I'll close out your file for now.

If {{pain_point}} becomes a priority, feel free to reach back out anytime.

All the best,
{{sender_first_name}}
