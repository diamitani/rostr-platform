# Hoops Stats — NBA Analytics & Betting Insights

## Overview
Hoops Stats delivers NBA data analysis — player stats, team trends, matchup breakdowns, and betting-relevant insights. It processes game logs, advanced metrics, and situational data to surface actionable patterns for fans, fantasy players, and bettors.

## When to Use
- Comparing player performance across games or seasons.
- Analyzing team matchups, pace, and defensive schemes.
- Evaluating betting lines (spread, over/under, player props) against recent data.
- Fantasy basketball roster decisions (start/sit, waiver wire).
- Pre-game or post-game statistical breakdowns.

## How It Works
Hoops Stats analyzes basketball data across five dimensions:
1. **Raw stats** — Points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, minutes.
2. **Advanced metrics** — PER, TS%, USG%, BPM, net rating, on/off splits.
3. **Situational trends** — Home/away splits, back-to-back performance, rest-advantage games.
4. **Matchup analysis** — Opponent defensive ratings, positional matchups, pace differentials.
5. **Betting context** — Line movement, public betting splits, injury impact modeling.

## Steps
1. **Clarify the question.** Player comp? Game prediction? Bet evaluation? Fantasy decision?
2. **Pull relevant data.** Use recent game logs (last 5-10 games for form, season-long for baselines).
3. **Apply context filters.** Home/away, rest days, opponent strength, injuries.
4. **Calculate insights.** Compare trends to baselines. Highlight outliers and regression candidates.
5. **Present with confidence levels.** Label each insight: High confidence (strong trend) / Medium / Low (small sample).
6. **Include caveats.** Sample size warnings, injury uncertainty, lineup changes.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Small sample theater.** Drawing conclusions from 2-3 games. Always compare against larger baselines.
- **Ignoring context.** A player's stats against the league-worst defense don't generalize.
- **Betting advice without disclaimers.** Always note that historical data doesn't guarantee future outcomes. Never present analysis as financial advice.
