# Prompt Builder Architect

## Overview

Transform a raw app idea into a structured, platform-aware prompt set that targets v0.dev, Cursor, Replit, and lovable.dev. Each platform has unique prompt formats and constraints — this skill generates prompts optimized for each so you can prototype faster across tools.

## When to Use

- A user says "I have an app idea" and wants to start building
- You need to generate v0.dev prompts to scaffold UI components
- You're planning a multi-tool workflow (Cursor for backend, v0 for UI, Replit for deployment)
- A user is evaluating which AI builder best fits their project
- You need tiered prompt sets (free vs. pro plan prompts for each platform)

## How It Works

1. **Idea Intake** — Extract the core concept, target users, key features, and tech preferences.
2. **Platform Mapping** — For each platform, determine what it does best and assign sub-tasks:
   - **v0.dev**: UI components, page layouts, design systems (React/Tailwind/shadcn)
   - **Cursor**: Backend logic, database schemas, API routes, complex business logic
   - **Replit**: Full-stack prototypes, quick deploys, collaborative iteration
   - **lovable.dev**: End-to-end full-stack apps with auth, DB, and deployment
3. **Prompt Generation** — Produce modular prompts for each platform following their specific best practices.
4. **Plan Tiering** — Adapt prompt detail to the user's plan tier (free = concise, pro = comprehensive).

## Steps

### Step 1: Gather Requirements
Ask targeted questions:
- What does the app do? (one-sentence pitch)
- Who is the primary user?
- What are the 3-5 core features?
- Any tech stack preferences? (React, Next.js, TypeScript, etc.)
- Do you have accounts on v0 / Cursor / Replit / lovable?

### Step 2: Select Platforms
Based on the app's complexity and user's access, recommend which platforms to use:
- **Simple UI-heavy apps** → v0.dev first
- **Logic/backend-heavy** → Cursor first
- **Quick full-stack prototype** → Replit or lovable.dev
- **Production-ready full-stack** → Cursor + v0.dev combination

### Step 3: Write Platform Prompts
For each selected platform, craft prompts in their native style:

**v0.dev prompt format:**
```
Create a [component/page] for [app name] that:
- Uses React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- [specific layout requirements]
- [state management needs]
- [responsive behavior]
- Match this design tone: [description]
```

**Cursor prompt format:**
```
// File: [path]
// Task: [what to build]
// Context: [relevant project info]
// Constraints: [limits/rules]
// Acceptance: [how to verify it works]
```

**Replit prompt format:**
```
Build a [app type] with:
- Stack: [framework/db/auth]
- Features: [bullet list]
- UI: [design direction]
- Deploy target: [Replit hosting / custom domain]
```

**lovable.dev prompt format:**
```
Full-stack app: [name]
Description: [2-3 sentences]
Core features:
1. [feature with auth requirement]
2. [feature with DB table]
3. [feature with API call]
Tech stack: [Next.js / Supabase / etc.]
```

### Step 4: Tier Adjustments
- **Free tier**: Max 2-3 prompts per platform, concise, one-shot execution
- **Pro tier**: 5-10 prompts, modular files, incremental build steps, error recovery hints

### Step 5: Deliver Prompt Set
Present as a collapsible, numbered list grouped by platform. Include:
- Platform name + purpose
- Copy-paste-ready prompts
- Execution order (what to run first)
- Expected output per prompt
- Tips for fixing common errors per platform

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-prompting v0.dev**: v0 works best with focused, single-component prompts. Don't ask for an entire app in one prompt.
- **Under-specifying Cursor prompts**: Cursor needs file paths, context, and acceptance criteria to produce good code.
- **Ignoring plan limits**: Free-tier v0 and Replit have message/credits limits. Batch wisely.
- **Wrong platform for the job**: Don't use v0 for database schema design; don't use Cursor for pure UI layout.
