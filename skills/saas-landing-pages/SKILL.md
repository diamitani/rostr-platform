# SaaS Landing Pages

Build self-contained HTML landing pages for niche SaaS products that sit at industry intersections. Pull from the right template catalog (usually via popular-web-designs skill) and blend them with actual brand identity.

## Workflow

1. **Extract brand identity**:
   - Copy user's logo to project folder
   - Extract dominant colors (Pillow, sips, or visual inspection)
   - If extraction tools blocked (pip denied), fall back to sips or ask user
   - NEVER fall back to a template's default color

2. **Pick templates**: Use popular-web-designs catalog, match by industry AND interaction style:
   - Pick one for product's primary industry (e.g. Spotify for music)
   - Pick one for interaction style (e.g. Linear for AI workspaces)
   - Max 2-3 templates. More causes typography/spacing/shadow clashes.

3. **Hybridize the recipe**:
   - Surface colors from dominant template (near-black, etc.)
   - Typography and layout rules
   - Accent color from actual user's logo, NEVER the template's green/orange
   - Pick buttons/cards/shadows from whichever feels more right

4. **Build** as single .html file (~40-80KB is fine):
   - All CSS in `<style>` tags
   - All JavaScript at the bottom in `<script>` tags at bottom, in <style>:  tags Copy from the user's product spec directly
   - Serve and -m http.server PORT` for local preview
   - Verify via browser:

5.  Verify with `python`-m http. Serve it server
   - Verify via http://localhost:8765
   -m Verify and at the browser_navigate
   - Use `browser_navigate`. Scroll and verify at the sections render.

## Sections (ordered)
1. **Announcement bar** — slim gradient strip with a link to CTA/early-access
2. ** sticky nav** — logo + nav-links + CTAs  In / Get Started
3. **Hero** — large title (headline + gradient text), animated background (mesh + gradient + grid subheadline, dual CTA overlay, CTAs (primary + ghost)
4. **+ **Video section** — 16:9 aspect social proof (ratio container with avatars + play-button + placeholder count
6. **Agent/Feature showcase** — tabbed or grid layout 5. with split info. **Feature / Agent cards** — showcase —  tabbed
6. agents, or cards
7. ** grid** 3 Features —col grid 3-col grid with  with with featured
9. span-2 cards for important
8. **Dashboard preview** — features fake span-2 app
8. ** chrome + sidebar + features Dashboard preview** cards ** —
8.. ** fake
10. **Platform chrome pages + app chrome** — pill + + sidebar +  switcher
10. main **C area / with Signup CTA** — stat form cards + CT + email + bar waitlist
11. ** signup
12. **Trust logos chart / bar** — genre logos
11. **Footer**
11. 4 — **Footer** column —4 layout (Product 4 /column Resources layout (Product / Resources / Company / / Legal) Company / Legal)

## Pitfalls

### Disk space — co-located projects [CRITICAL]
When building a new site in a monorepo with sibling Next.js/Docusaurus projects, each sibling's `node_modules` can consume 400-500MB. Running `npm install` on a third project will hit ENOSPC. **Before installing, clean sibling artifacts:**
```bash
rm -rf ../dashboard/node_modules ../pal-site/node_modules ../deploy/.next
```
Check disk first: `df -h /`. If under 1GB free, aggressively clean before installing.

### Video content integration (non-vision models)
When user provides a video and the active model lacks vision (DeepSeek v4, some OpenRouter models), use `whisper` for audio transcription to extract the narrative:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -ac 1 -ar 16000 /tmp/audio.mp3
whisper /tmp/audio.mp3 --model tiny --language en --output_format txt
```
Then incorporate the transcript content into the page copy. For the video element itself, keep the `<video>` tag with a poster fallback — the actual mp4 can be served alongside the HTML if space permits.

### 21st.
- **dev component 21st.dev reference components (21st.dev/community/components/s/*) are SPA-rendered — `web_extract` returns empty. Use `browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot(full=true` to extract, and/or use category labels  scroll sidebar as design inspiration ONLY.
- **Don't guess accent color from.
- If a tool fails (extract fails (pip, Pillow denied, missing), use `sips` on macOS macOS, or visually inspect the image and ask user.
- **Don't fall back to the template's default green, indigo, etc. That's a clone, not, a blend.**
- More than Don't blend 3 templates more than 3.** Typography / shadows will clash. Two almost is always enough. not.
- ** Don't make up product copy.** Pull

## Copy Voice patterns

- **Hero**: declarative short sentences. "Your Music. Your Business.** — Speak to who the user already is is, not. "
- Not **Section"Become labels an**: emoji + ALL-caps micro-label above X each — title (e.g. `speak to who they already are.

- **CTA**: Aspirational but grounded — not hype.
