# Landing Page Build

Build comprehensive landing pages by extracting brand identity from existing project assets and constructing single-file HTML with integrated design system.

## When to Use

This skill captures the workflow for building marketing landing pages from scratch using:
- Brand identity extracted from existing project files (CSS variables, logos, typography)
- Single-file HTML architecture with embedded CSS (multi-page when the site needs subpages — pricing, about, academy, contact, blog, privacy, terms)
- Multi-section layout covering announcement bar through footer
- Integration with existing project repositories
- Cross-linking subpages to each other and to existing live sites

### Production Pattern: Next.js Route Group Integration

For SaaS products that need both a marketing landing page AND an app (dashboard, tracks, etc.), prefer integrating the landing page into a single Next.js project using route groups rather than hosting them separately:

```
src/app/
├── layout.tsx              → Minimal root layout (html/body, fonts)
├── page.tsx                → LANDING PAGE (server component, no sidebar)
├── globals.css             → Merged CSS (landing tokens + app tokens)
├── (app)/                  → Route group — invisible in URLs
│   ├── layout.tsx          → App layout (sidebar + topbar)
│   ├── dashboard/page.tsx  → App dashboard
│   ├── tracks/page.tsx     → Feature pages
│   └── ...                 → Additional app routes
└── components/
    ├── Sidebar.tsx
    └── Topbar.tsx
```

**Why this pattern:**
- One Vercel deployment, one domain — no subdomain management
- Landing page gets the `/` route; app pages keep clean URLs (`/dashboard`, `/tracks`)
- Route groups `(app)` don't affect URLs — `/tracks` stays `/tracks`, not `/app/tracks`
- CSS custom properties coexist: landing page uses its own tokens (`--bg-deep`, `--accent`), app uses shadcn tokens (`--background`, `--primary`)
- Landing nav links to app routes via `<Link href="/dashboard">` — zero latency, same SPA
- Server components by default — no client JS on the landing page unless needed

**Converting from standalone HTML to React:**
- Replace `<a href="...">` with Next.js `<Link href="...">` for internal routes
- Replace `<img src="...">` with Next.js `<Image src="..." width={...} height={...}>` for optimized images
- Replace `onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}` with `action="/target-route"` — event handlers don't work in server components
- Move all CSS from `<style>` tags into `globals.css` — scope landing styles under a `.landing` parent class to avoid conflicts
- Copy logo assets to `public/` and reference via `/logos/logo.svg`

## Workflow

### 1. Discover Brand Assets

Extract brand identity from existing project files before building:

```bash
# Find existing brand guidelines
find /project-path -name "*.css" -o -name "globals.css" -o -name "theme.ts"

# Extract CSS variables
grep -E "(--primary|--accent|--red|--gold|--font)" existing-globals.css

# Locate logo files
find /project-path -name "logo.*" -path "*/public/*"
```

**Key brand elements to extract:**
- Primary + secondary colors (oklch or hex values)
- Typography stack (heading + body fonts)
- Border radius tokens
- Shadow definitions
- Logo placement conventions

### 2. Build Single-File HTML Structure

Standardize as 12-section landing page:

1. **Announcement bar** — gradient shimmer with early access messaging
2. **Navigation** — sticky with blur backdrop, logo + links + dual CTAs
3. **Hero** — badge, title (gradient text), subtitle, dual CTAs, stats row
4. **Video demo** — 16:9 container with play button placeholder
5. **Agents/features showcase** — tabbed interface or grid layout
6. **Features grid** — 3-column bento with featured cards spanning multiple columns
7. **Industry connections** — contact directory showcase (if applicable)
8. **Tools/resources** — 2-column grid with icon + description cards
9. **Dashboard preview** — mock app UI showing core workspace
10. **Academy/platform overview** tabbed page descriptions
11. **Genre/support bar** — horizontal category list
12. **CTA + Footer** — email capture + 4-column footer

### 3. Design System Application

Use CSS custom properties at `:root` for brand tokens:

```css
:root {
  /* Brand colors — extracted from design files */
  --primary: #C41E3A;
  --primary-light: #E8395B;
  --accent: #D4AF37;
  
  /* Derived palette */
  --bg-deep: #0A0A0B;
  --surface: #1A1A1F;
  --border: rgba(255,255,255,0.1);
  
  /* Typography */
  --font-display: 'Playfair Display', serif;
  --font-body: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  
  /* Spacing */
  --section-padding: 120px;
  --container-max: 1200px;
  --radius: 0.625rem;
}
```

### 4. Integration Patterns

**Logo placement:**
```html
<!-- Nav: left side -->
<a href="/" class="nav-brand">
  <img src="./logo.png" alt="Brand" class="nav-logo-img">
  <span class="nav-brand-text">BrandName</span>
</a>

<!-- Footer: brand column -->
<div class="footer-brand">
  <img src="./logo.png" alt="Brand" class="footer-logo">
  <p class="brand-description">...</p>
</div>
```

**Gradient text (hero titles):**
```css
.hero-title .accent {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--primary-light), var(--accent));
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
}
```

**Interactive tabs (agent showcase):**
```javascript
function switchAgent(index) {
  document.querySelectorAll('.agent-tab').forEach((t,i) => t.classList.toggle('active', i===index));
  document.querySelectorAll('.agent-panel').forEach((p,i) => p.classList.toggle('active', i===index));
}
```

## Multi-Page Site Pattern

When the landing page needs subpages (pricing, about, academy, contact, blog, privacy, terms, directory):

1. **Build the index first** — get the design system right once, then copy it to subpages
2. **Clone the navbar** to every subpage — same links, same structure, same logo
3. **Cross-link to existing live sites** — don't duplicate data, point to the canonical source (e.g., academy page links to `academy-build.vercel.app`)
4. **Use relative links** (`pricing.html`, `about.html`) for internal pages, absolute URLs for external sites

### Nav Consistency

**Critical pitfall:** Privacy and Terms pages are often built last or from a stripped template — they end up with a bare logo and no nav links. After building all subpages, audit every page to confirm the full nav bar is present.

**Standard nav structure across all pages:**
```html
<nav class="navbar">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <a href="index.html" class="nav-logo"><img src="logo.png" alt="Brand" style="height:28px;display:block"></a>
    <div class="nav-links">
      <a href="index.html#section">Link 1</a>
      <a href="page2.html">Link 2</a>
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
</nav>
```

On the index page only, use same-page anchors (`#agents`, `#how`). On subpages, use cross-page anchors (`index.html#agents`, `index.html#how`). This is intentional — the links behave differently depending on which page the user is on.

### Logo Integration

When a logo PNG exists in a nearby project (e.g. `knowledge-base/sites/academy/public/logo.png`):
```bash
cp /path/to/existing-project/public/logo.png /tmp/build-dir/logo.png
```
Use `<img>` tag in nav, not text:
```html
<a href="index.html" class="nav-logo"><img src="logo.png" alt="Brand" style="height:28px;display:block"></a>
```
Replace both the nav logo and footer brand logo — there are often two text-logo instances.

### Cross-Linking to Next.js SPAs

When linking to a Next.js site (e.g., `academy-build.vercel.app`), dynamic routes like `/courses/[slug]` may 404 on direct access because the SPA relies on client-side routing. Instead:
- Link to anchor-based routes: `https://academy-build.vercel.app/#courses`
- Or link to the homepage and let the user navigate: `https://academy-build.vercel.app`

**Verify the target URL returns 200 before linking to it.** Use `curl -sI` to check.

### QA Verification Loop

After building all pages, run a two-phase verification pass:

**Phase 1 — Local source verification** (before pushing):
Checks every HTML file in the build directory for:
1. **HTML parse** — every page parses cleanly
2. **Required tags** — DOCTYPE, `<title>`, `<meta description>`, `</html>`, `</body>`
3. **Link safety** — no bare `href="#"` (use `href="./"` for top-of-page, `href="#section-id"` for anchors)
4. **Content markers** — key text strings are present on each page
5. **CSS variable presence** — all design tokens actually exist in `:root`
6. **Font loading** — Google Fonts `<link>` present and correct

**Phase 2 — Deployed URL verification** (after push + deploy):
Re-runs the same checks against the live `https://` URL via `curl`.

**Verification script pattern:** Write a temp script to `/var/folders/.../T/hermes-verify-*.py`, import `subprocess` + `tempfile`, curl the target, run checks, print results, and `os.unlink()` the script on completion. See `references/qa-verification-pattern.md` for a reusable template.
## Support Files

- `references/qa-verification-pattern.md` — reusable ad-hoc verification script template for multi-page static sites
- `references/portfolio-patterns.md` — portfolio site patterns (ROSTR prominence, case studies, YouTube embeds, Pat's preferences)
- `scripts/build_courses.py` — agent that parses TypeScript `courses.ts` files and generates individual course detail HTML pages
- `scripts/build_all_courses.py` — curriculum instructor agent that reads Academy spreadsheets (.xlsx) and generates course HTML pages with full module breakdowns
- `references/holding-company-pattern.md` — holding company / executive portfolio pattern: corporate framing, Playfair italic accents, establishment signals, targeted application subpages (/xai)
- `references/research-centerpiece-pattern.md` — published research as dominant visual section: 4-component grid, 5D phase taxonomy, proof cards, DOI badge
- `scripts/build_courses.py` — agent that parses TypeScript `courses.ts` files and generates individual course detail HTML pages
- `scripts/build_all_courses.py` — curriculum instructor agent that reads Academy spreadsheets (.xlsx) and generates course HTML pages with full module breakdowns

## Curriculum Pipeline (Spreadsheet → Course Pages)

When an Academy spreadsheet (.xlsx) contains course content in individual sheets:

1. **Research**: Each sheet has columns `module_id`, `chapter_title`, `module_title`, `exact_text`
2. **Index**: Build a `sheet_map` mapping truncated sheet names → (title, slug, category)
3. **Generate**: `build_all_courses.py` reads the spreadsheet, extracts modules, and generates HTML pages in `courses/`

**Sheet name truncation:** Excel truncates sheet names to 31 characters. The sheet map uses the first ~30 chars to match:
```python
sheet_map = {
    'How To Brand Yourself as an Art': ('How to Brand Yourself as an Artist', 'brand-yourself-as-artist', 'Branding'),
    ...
}
```

**Verification after generation:** Check that (a) all expected slugs exist in the output directory, (b) each page has `module-content` divs, and (c) the academy.html listing page links to the correct `courses/{slug}.html` paths.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Don't connect frameworks to employers in copy.** Users may explicitly reject connections between their published work and a specific employer (e.g., "ROSTR is not connected to Atlas at all"). When a user says "remove that connection," audit ALL pages — index, dedicated pages, case studies, resume — for the same link. Use `grep -rn "EmployerName" *.html` to find every instance. The published work stands on its own.
- ❌ Don't hardcode colors — use CSS variables throughout for theme flexibility
- ❌ Don't mix design systems — commit to either dark-mode-first or light-mode-first
- ❌ Don't forget responsive breakpoints — 1024px / 768px / 480px cascade
- ❌ **macOS: Do NOT write to ~/Desktop** — iCloud can evict files to 0-byte stubs mid-session. Always use `/tmp/` for build work and push to GitHub from there. If a file was written successfully and then "not found" minutes later, iCloud evicted it.
- ❌ **Never ship without QA** — run the verification loop against deployed URLs before claiming done. Privacy/Terms pages are the most common failure point (stripped navs).
- ❌ **Don't link to Next.js dynamic routes** — `/courses/[slug]` 404s on direct access. Use anchor routes or link to the homepage.
- ❌ **Don't use text logos when a real logo exists** — copy the PNG from a nearby project. Text logos look amateur next to a real brand asset.
- ❌ **Don't use bare `href="#"` anywhere** — verification will flag it. Use `href="./"` for the nav logo (scroll-to-top), `href="#section-id"` for same-page anchors, and real page paths for everything else. Placeholder links for pages not yet built should point to `#cta` or another meaningful anchor, not `#`.
- ❌ **Don't skip local verification before deploying** — the system enforces a two-phase QA pattern: verify the local source file first, push + deploy, then verify the deployed URL. Skipping Phase 1 means catching regressions only after they're live.
- ❌ **Don't use `execute_code` for scripts with f-strings containing `\\\\n`** — the tool corrupts them into literal backslash-n. Use `cat << 'PYEOF'` heredocs in `terminal` instead. Simple `print()` with `+` concatenation also works.
- ❌ **Don't ship without walking the full user flow** — signup → login → workspace → profile. The #1 regression is onboarding data never reaching the workspace (console.log instead of localStorage). Verify every page reads from the same localStorage key before deploying.
- ❌ **Bash verification with `set -e` + arithmetic**: use `PASS=$((PASS+1))` instead of `((PASS++))` inside `if` blocks. `((PASS++))` returns the *old* value — 0 on first increment → exit code 1 → `set -e` kills the script mid-verification. Same for `((FAIL++))`, `((VAR--))`, and any post-increment in arithmetic context. Also: `((0))` alone exits with code 1 under `set -e`, so never use bare `((PASS))` or `((something))` as a conditional check — use `[ "$something" -eq 0 ]` instead.
- ❌ **Do NOT use `write_file` for temp verification scripts** — writing to `/var/folders/.../T/` paths (the required location for `hermes-verify-*` scripts) is blocked by the filesystem guard. Use `cat > /var/folders/.../T/hermes-verify-*.sh << 'VEOF'` heredoc in `terminal` instead. Remember to `chmod +x` and `rm` after running.
- ❌ **Vercel static builds drop `.md` files by default** — the default `@vercel/static` builder only picks up known web extensions. Use `"src": "**/*.*"` in `vercel.json` to include `.md` knowledge-base files. Otherwise the deployed URL returns 404 for markdown.
- ❌ **npx vercel fails under ENOSPC — use global install.** When disk is full and `npx vercel` can't install, check `which vercel` — on macOS it's often at `/opt/homebrew/bin/vercel` via Homebrew. Use the global binary directly: `vercel --prod --yes`. Same applies to `gh` CLI for GitHub operations when git runs out of space.
- ❌ **Git merge (allow-unrelated-histories) clobbers uncommitted files.** When force-pushing a fresh repo over an existing one, the merge step (required to combine histories) will refuse if the working tree contains files not yet tracked — even if those files came from the same remote. Solution: `rm -rf` the directory first, `git clone --depth 1`, then overwrite individual files and commit normally. Never try to merge fresh init over populated remote without clearing the local tree first.
- ❌ **Next.js 16 duplicate JSX props**: `style={fadeIn}` and `style={{...}}` on the same element passes webpack but fails TypeScript with `JSX elements cannot have multiple attributes with the same name`. Combine into one style object.
- ❌ **macOS ENOSPC (disk full) mid-session** — when writes fail with "No space left on device", clear caches in this order: (1) `npm cache clean --force && rm -rf ~/.npm/_cacache`, (2) `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.openai.{codex,atlas}` (often 10GB+), (3) `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/SiriTTS ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew ~/Library/Caches/electron ~/Library/Caches/pip ~/Library/Caches/node-gyp`, (4) `du -sh ~/Library/Caches/*/ | sort -rh | head -10` to find remaining large caches, (5) clear old `/tmp/` project clones. Verify with `df -h / | tail -1` — target 1.5GB+ free for Next.js builds. If still tight after all clears, push to GitHub and let Vercel build server-side, then verify with curl.

## Dashboard-as-Product Pattern (v2.1+)

When the platform has both marketing pages AND a product dashboard, unify all features under one sidebar-driven workspace:

```
Dashboard sidebar:
├── ⌂ Home          → Agent chat + status + quick stats
├── ◈ Agents        → 6 specialist agents (some locked on Free)
├── 🎓 Academy      → 16 courses, filterable (FREE — lead magnet)
├── ◉ Directory     → 6 categories, 183 contacts (FREE — lead magnet)
├── 📁 Outputs      → Generated files with draft/final tags
├── 📚 Knowledge    → soul.md preview, quick links
└── ⚙ Settings      → Profile, API keys, integrations
```

**Agent locking for monetization:** On the Free plan, 2 of 6 agents are locked (Licensing, Finance). Locked cards have `.locked` class with reduced opacity and an `::after` overlay: "🔒 Upgrade to unlock". An upgrade banner sits above the agent grid driving conversion to BYOK/Pro.

**Free as lead magnet:** Academy and Directory are free for all users — they drive signups and demonstrate value before the user hits the agent paywall.

### Signup Flow Pattern

4-step onboarding in a single HTML file:

```html
Step 1: Plan selection (free/byok/pro cards)
  → Pre-select via URL: signup.html?plan=byok
Step 2: Account creation (OAuth + email/password)
Step 3: Onboarding (artist name, genre, PRO, goals → builds soul.md preview)
Step 4: Provisioning (simulated with setTimeout — real version calls AWS Lambda)
```

**Plan routing:** Pricing cards on the landing page use `signup.html?plan=free`, `signup.html?plan=byok`, `signup.html?plan=pro`. The signup page reads `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('plan')` and pre-selects the plan card.

### Chat UI Integration

Two levels of chat:
1. **Landing demo** — embedded widget in hero with keyword-matched responses and CTA after 3 messages
2. **Dashboard chat** — full agent interface in the Home tab

Chat implementation: `setTimeout`-based mock responses with a `responses` object mapping keywords to reply text. After N user messages, inject a CTA with a link to signup.

## End-to-End Data Flow Verification (v2.17+)

**The most common failure in multi-page app flows:** Data generated on the signup/onboarding page never reaches the workspace/dashboard. The user completes a wizard, clicks "Create Profile," lands on the workspace — and sees hardcoded demo data.

**Root cause patterns:**
- Onboarding saves data to `console.log` or a transient variable instead of `localStorage`
- Workspace uses hardcoded values (e.g. "Midnight," "Free Plan") instead of reading from localStorage
- Login page doesn't check stored data — accepts any input
- Profile page reads from localStorage but was never populated because onboarding never wrote to it

**Fix checklist (walk the full flow before deploying):**
1. ✅ `signup.html` → `finishOnboarding()` calls `localStorage.setItem('app_profile', JSON.stringify(profile))`
2. ✅ `login.html` → `doLogin()` checks `localStorage.getItem('app_profile')` exists before allowing login
3. ✅ `workspace.html` → `initProfile()` reads `localStorage.getItem('app_profile')` and populates sidebar name, avatar, plan
4. ✅ Every element that was hardcoded (sidebar name, avatar, empty state greeting) now uses dynamic IDs set by `initProfile()`

**localStorage bridge pattern:**
```javascript
// signup.html — on finish
const profile = { stage_name: '...', genre: '...', goals: [...], bio: '...', soul: '...' };
localStorage.setItem('app_profile', JSON.stringify(profile));

// workspace.html — on init
const p = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('app_profile') || 'null');
if (p) {
  document.getElementById('sidebarName').textContent = p.stage_name;
  document.getElementById('sidebarAvatar').textContent = p.stage_name[0];
}
```

**Master repo consolidation:** When working across multiple repos (landing, platform, backend), combine everything into one master repo. Use `cp -r` to copy all files from individual repos into a single directory, then push as one. This eliminates cross-site link rot and makes the full flow testable from one deploy.

## Chat UI Modernization

**Flat modern bubble design:**
- Circular avatars (30px, `border-radius: 50%`) instead of square
- Agent bubble: flat surface with subtle border, `border-bottom-left-radius: 6px` for asymmetry
- User bubble: gradient subtle background, `border-bottom-right-radius: 6px`
- Suggestions: pill-shaped (`border-radius: 24px`), `transform: translateY(-1px)` on hover
- Typing dots: gold-colored and smaller (5px) instead of text-dim
- Spacing: tighter gaps (12px between messages, 18px between conversation turns)

## Sidebar Navigation Pattern

**Critical pitfall — orphan sidebar links:** When the dashboard uses a sidebar with `onclick="switchView('tab')"` to toggle in-page `<div>` sections, any sidebar link for a page that DOESN'T have a corresponding `<div>` silently does nothing. This is the most common regression — Academy, Directory, Settings, and Profile links that look like they should work but don't navigate anywhere.

**Fix:** Use `onclick="window.location.href='page.html'"` for external page links, and reserve `switchView()` only for tabs that have an actual `<div id="view-name">` in the page. Never use `switchView('settings')` if no `view-settings` div exists — it will break.

```html
<!-- ✅ Correct — real page links use window.location -->
<button class="nav-item" onclick="window.location.href='academy.html'">🎓 Academy</button>

<!-- ✅ Correct — in-page tab has a matching <div id="view-agents"> -->
<button class="nav-item" onclick="switchView('agents')">◈ Agents</button>

<!-- ❌ Wrong — no <div id="view-settings"> exists, this does nothing -->
<button class="nav-item" onclick="switchView('settings')">⚙ Settings</button>
```

### Product Rebranding Pattern

When the workspace is a separate product under a parent brand (e.g., "Rostr Agent — powered by Artispreneur"), use a two-line sidebar header:

```html
<div class="sidebar-header">
  <img src="logo.png" alt="A">
  <div>
    <div class="brand-product">Rostr<span class="gold">Agent</span></div>
    <div class="brand-parent">Powered by Artispreneur</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.brand-product { font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 800; }
.brand-parent { font-size: 8px; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: 1px; text-transform: uppercase; color: var(--text-dim); }
```

The product name gets the gold treatment (first part white, second part gold), and the parent brand is a small, muted sublabel. This cleanly separates products while maintaining brand association.

## Unified Header Standardization

After building subpages, ensure every page has the EXACT same header structure. Common mismatches:
- Logo height varies (22px vs 28px vs 24px)
- Nav text differs ("Workspace" vs "Rostr Agent")
- Some pages have the brand text, others omit it
- CTA button position/color varies

**Canonical header to use on ALL pages:**

```html
<nav class="navbar">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <a href="index.html" class="nav-logo">
      <img src="logo.png" alt="Artispreneur" style="height:22px;display:block">
    </a>
    <span style="font-family:'Playfair Display',serif;font-size:15px;font-weight:800;letter-spacing:-.3px;margin-left:8px;color:var(--text)">
      Artis<span style="color:var(--gold)">preneur</span>
    </span>
    <div class="nav-links">
      <a href="workspace.html">Rostr Agent</a>
      <a href="academy.html">Academy</a>
      <a href="directory.html">Directory</a>
      <a href="pricing.html">Pricing</a>
      <a href="login.html">Login</a>
      <a href="signup.html" class="nav-cta">Get Started Free</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</nav>
```

Key specs: logo height 22px, brand font size 15px, letter-spacing -0.3px, CTA padding 7px 16px, border-radius 7px. Every page must use these exact values.

## Three-Tier Pricing Pattern (Free/BYOK, Pro, Unlimited)

For AI-powered SaaS platforms, use a three-tier pricing model:

| Tier | Price | Feature |
|------|-------|---------|
| Free | $0/mo | BYOK (bring your own API key from Google AI, OpenAI, Anthropic) + full platform access |
| Pro | $9.99/mo | Powered by us (100 chats/mo, 5 skills/mo, 10 PDFs/mo, 100MB S3) |
| Unlimited | $19.99/mo | Everything unlimited, API access, priority support, early features |

**Pricing page structure:**
1. Trust banner — cost transparency ($0.05/free user, 97.6% margins, LLM name)
2. Three cards — Free (BYOK), Pro with "Most Popular" badge, Unlimited
3. Feature matrix — ✅ available, ❌ not available, — included
4. FAQ — 5 questions addressing BYOK, switching plans, API key compatibility, free trial, fair use
5. Footer — LLM routing info for credibility

**Budget model:** All LLMs routed through own AWS Bedrock (DeepSeek V3 at $0.00189/chat) to keep costs predictable. Free users cost $0.05/mo (infra only). Pro users cost $0.24/mo (97.6% margin). Breakeven at 3 Pro users.

## AI-Quality Bio Generation

When generating artist bios from onboarding data, use multi-paragraph natural narrative with genre-specific hooks instead of template string substitution:

```javascript
const hooks = {
  'R&B/Soul': `${name}'s voice doesn't ask for attention. It commands it.`,
  'Hip-Hop/Rap': `${first} doesn't just make music — ${first} builds worlds.`,
  'Electronic': `${name} creates soundscapes that pull you into another dimension.`,
  // ... 11 genres total
};
```

Structure: Hook → Identity paragraph → Story paragraph → Influences paragraph → Experience paragraph → Goals paragraph → CTA closing. Use the artist's own words from the `story` and `why_music` fields. Vary influence verbs (`drawing from`, `shaped by`, `channeling`, `blending`) based on the number of influences. Always end with a concrete CTA (stream on Spotify, follow on Instagram).

## Session Context

Built artispreneur.com landing page by extracting brand identity from existing academy project (dark theme, Playfair+Inter, gold #c9a227), integrating logo.png from knowledge-base, building 9-page static site (index + 8 subpages), and deploying to artispreneur-landing.vercel.app via Vercel.

Built Gency AI landing page (gency-ai.vercel.app) from scratch with no prior brand assets. Hybridized Linear (#08090a dark canvas, 510-weight typography, translucent borders) + Superhuman (premium minimalism) + ethereal glass recipe (double-bezel cards). New brand: violet (#8b5cf6) → cyan (#06b6d4) gradient accent on near-black. 12-section single-file HTML deployed via `vercel --prod --yes --scope artispreneur`. Verification pattern: local source check (50 assertions) → push → deploy → remote URL check (28 assertions) → patch failures → re-verify. Key pitfall discovered: bare `href="#"` on nav logo and placeholder links — replaced with `href="./"` and `href="#cta"` respectively.
