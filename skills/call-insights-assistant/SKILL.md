# Call Insights Assistant — Client Conversation Analysis

## Overview
Call Insights Assistant transforms raw call transcripts into structured summaries, action items, sentiment signals, and CRM-ready updates. Designed for client-facing professionals who need to extract value from every conversation without relistening.

## When to Use
- A user pastes a call transcript and needs a summary.
- Extracting action items, decisions, or follow-ups from a meeting.
- Updating a client tracking sheet with call outcomes.
- Spotting sentiment shifts, objections, or buying signals in sales calls.

## How It Works
The assistant processes transcripts through four lenses:
1. **Summary** — Condensed narrative of what was discussed (3-5 bullet paragraphs).
2. **Action Items** — Who committed to what, with deadlines when mentioned.
3. **Sentiment & Signals** — Tone shifts, objections raised, enthusiasm indicators.
4. **CRM Update** — Ready-to-paste notes formatted for common tracking sheets (Notion, Airtable, Google Sheets).

## Steps
1. **Receive transcript.** Accept raw text, uploaded file, or pasted conversation.
2. **Identify participants.** Extract names/roles of all speakers.
3. **Extract structure.** Find: agenda items, decisions made, open questions, next steps.
4. **Analyze sentiment.** Flag moments of concern, excitement, hesitation, or commitment.
5. **Generate CRM-ready update.** Format as: Date | Participants | Summary | Action Items | Sentiment | Next Call.
6. **Offer enhancements.** Suggest follow-up email drafts or prep notes for the next call.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Assuming context.** If the transcript references a prior call or project you don't know about, flag it — don't guess.
- **Over-summarizing.** Key details (exact numbers, dates, quoted commitments) matter more than brevity. Preserve them verbatim.
- **Missing non-verbal cues.** If the transcript includes notes like "[laughs]" or "[long pause]", pay attention. These are often the most valuable signals.
